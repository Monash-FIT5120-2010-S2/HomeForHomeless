                <h2> Age Requirements</h2>

                <p>In Victoria, the legal age to start volunteering is 15 years old, if you are in high school, have excellent time management skills and are already on top of your studies, you may begin your volunteering journey now! It looks great on the extracurricular section of your resume.</p>
                <h2>Process Requirements</h2>
                <p>Although volunteering is for a great cause, you should be careful in the process. You should ensure that the organization you are volunteering at is legitimate by doing a background check of your own, ensure the values of the organization synchronizes with your own and are able to provide you with the proper insurances and provide you a safe work environment. You should also ensure that the role you have been assigned is clear, they can provide you with written information about their purpose and activities and are using their resources in accordance with the organization's goals.</p>

                <h2>Responsibility</h2>

                <p> Being a volunteer is an important role. You should treat it like any other professional duty and be respectful to all respondents and their privacy. You should be on time and carry out your duties listed in your volunteer position description. When you get into a position where you are unsure of what to do or worried that you may be overstepping, it is always best to excuse yourself and first speak with your supervisor. </p>
                
                <h2>Your rights</h2>
                <p> Although you are not getting paid, a volunteer is entitled to many rights. You are entitled to work in a healthy and safe environment and be provided with written copies of the organisation’s volunteer policy and any other policies that may affect your position in the organization. Lastly, you are not to fill a position previously held by a paid worker as that is considered unpaid labour, which is unfair to you and illegal of the organization. </p>
