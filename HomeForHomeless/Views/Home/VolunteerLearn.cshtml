                <p>Homelessness is a global issue, even on the second most hospitable country in the world, homelessness is still existing. As of 2020, there are approximately 25000 homeless individuals on any given night. There are three types of homelessness: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary homelessness are people without conventional accommodation, which results them having to sleep rough or live in improvised dwellings such as parks and on the streets. Secondary homelessness are the people who frequently must move from one temporary shelter to another, such as emergency accommodation or youth refuges.

                <p>Opposite of common misconceptions,homelessness is not a choice. Many of the reasons for homelessness are completeout of the control of the individual and they usually find themselves in thatsituation spontaneously. For a lot of people, homelessness can happen at anytime. The most common age group we find in homeless individuals are, not middleaged men, but adults aged between 24-34 years of age. The truth is,homelessness affects all ages, genders, and background, with large percentageson all ranges of ages and even between genders.</p>

                <p>Another misconception people have regarding charitable organizations is that a lot of their work is about getting donations and sometimes even use the money for their own benefits. In reality, there are many ways to help homelessness and charitable organizations without money out of pocket. In reality, it is often more helpful for individuals to donate their time and effort by providing a range of services for the homeless or even give out old products that is no longer useful for them. Services such as collection of resources, providing goods and clothing, advocacy services, advice, skills and employment services, health services and financial support, even just talking to them to let them know they are still an important part of the community are all fantastic ways to help the homeless.</p>

                <p>XXX</p>
                <p>A common misconception about homelessindividuals is that they are more likely to commit crime or break the law. Thismay also be the reason for some volunteers opting to not work in the front lineand come in close proximity to the homeless. However, statistics show thathomeless individuals are more likely to be victims of crime rather thancommitting them. It is common for the homeless to get robbed and assaulted intheir space. Homeless people can be living on the streets, crowded dwellings oreven just staying at relatives or friends. All of these places put them indanger of being targets for exploitation.</p>
